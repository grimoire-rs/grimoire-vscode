<h1 align="center">Grimoire for VS Code</h1>

A marketplace UI for [grim](https://github.com/grimoire-rs/grimoire) — the
OCI-backed package manager for AI artifacts (skills, rules, agents, MCP servers,
and bundles). Search the catalog, read the docs, and install, update, and remove
artifacts without leaving the editor — the familiar Extensions view, but for the
AI artifacts your tools rely on.

## What it does

- **Browse the catalog** — the **Browse** tab searches every configured
  registry at once. Filter by kind with the chip row (Skill / Rule / Agent /
  MCP / Bundle).
- **Stay current** — the **Updates** tab lists every installed artifact with a
  newer version available (the tab and the activity-bar icon carry the count).
  **Update All** in the sidebar's title bar updates them in one click.
- **See what you have** — the **Installed** tab lists your installed artifacts,
  with a **Project / Global** toggle to switch which scope's list you're looking
  at. A status line pinned below the list shows when the catalog was last
  synced.
- **Read before you install** — open any artifact in an editor tab with
  **README**, **CONTENTS**, and **CHANGELOG** tabs and a metadata rail
  (installation status, package info, source and license, keywords). Single-click
  opens a reusable preview tab; double-click pins it, and links between artifacts
  navigate in place.
- **Instant details** — reopening an artifact paints immediately from an on-disk
  cache and refreshes in the background; top Browse results are prefetched so
  opens feel instant and card logos appear as they load.
- **Install, update, and uninstall per scope** — install into your **project**
  (`grimoire.toml` in the workspace) or **globally** (`~/.grimoire`), or both at
  once — a project install shadows the global one. Artifacts pulled in by a
  bundle point back to their bundle instead of offering a direct uninstall.
- **Pick a version** — install, downgrade, or pin an exact tag from the details
  header or a card's menu.
- **Share a link** — copy a `vscode://` deep link to any artifact; opening it
  reveals that artifact's details.
- **Get grim automatically** — if `grim` isn't on your `PATH`, Grimoire offers to
  download the latest release from GitHub (checksum-verified).
- **Stay up to date** — once a day Grimoire checks GitHub for a newer `grim`
  release. If it manages the binary it offers a one-click update; otherwise it
  links the release page. Turn it off with `grimoire.checkForUpdates`.
- **Live refresh** — watches `grimoire.toml` / `grimoire.lock` and refreshes the
  views when things change on disk, so the UI stays in sync with the `grim` CLI
  and its terminal UI (TUI).
- **Configure grim itself** — the $(settings-gear) icon opens a **Settings**
  editor tab with Project / Global peer tabs for every `grim config` key
  (registry, clients, TUI defaults, …) and registry management, backed
  directly by `grim config`/`grim config registry` — no separate copy of the
  config to keep in sync.

Installing artifacts runs the `grim` executable, so Grimoire's install actions
require a **trusted** workspace.

## Commands

Run from the Command Palette (all under the **Grimoire** category).

| `Grimoire: Open Settings`                      | Open the Settings editor tab (`grim config` UI)                                  |
| `Grimoire: Show Output`                        | Open the Grimoire output channel                                                 |

The `grimoire.openDetails` command is intentionally omitted — it's invoked via
the `vscode://` deep link, not run from the Command Palette.

## Settings

## Requirements

Grimoire drives the [grim](https://github.com/grimoire-rs/grimoire) CLI — it
doesn't reimplement it. If `grim` isn't found on your `PATH`, Grimoire offers to
install the latest release for you; you can also point `grimoire.path.executable`
at an existing build.

Grimoire requires `grim` 0.9.0 or newer — the release that ships the full
details interface (`describe`, description companions, digest probes). An older
build still browses and installs, but an artifact's README, changelog, and logo
may not appear. If you're on an older `grim`, point `grimoire.path.executable`
at a current one.
